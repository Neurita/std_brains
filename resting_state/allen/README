    - T-maps of all 75 components
    - T-maps of 28 resting state networks included in E. Allen et al.
    - Aggregate ICA Components

- Resting state from paper E. Allen, E. Damaraju, S. M. Plis, E. Erhardt, T. Eichele, and V. D.Calhoun, "Tracking whole-brain connectivity dynamics in the resting state", Cereb Cortex, Nov 2012.	
    - Aggregate ICA components
    - T-maps of all 100 components. Please see resting state networks file for component labels.
    - Composite t-maps of 7 groups resampled to 1mm^3 space and their labels.

- Mean group ICA components from paper M. Stevens, V. D. Calhoun, G. D. Pearlson, and K. A. Kiehl, "Brain network dynamics during error commission," Hum.Brain Map., vol. 30, pp. 24-37, 2009.

Notes
-----
Keep in mind that the label files start to count from 1.
